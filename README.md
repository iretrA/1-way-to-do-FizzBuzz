# 1-way-to-do-FizzBuzz
These are answers to the question Fizz Buzz. Fizz Buzz is a simple children's game used to act as a kind of stoppage for those who are non-programmers or have little practical knowledge in getting programming jobs. These solutions use the Leetcode version of the problem. All of these solutions are in python, though I made add more languages as if I learn more.
